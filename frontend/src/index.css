/**
 * Ringmaster Global Styles
 *
 * NOTE: This file was originally a Vite template with styles designed for a landing page.
 * Those styles (display: flex on body, large h1 font-size) were incompatible with the
 * Ringmaster app layout, causing elements to have zero height and E2E tests to fail.
 *
 * This has been replaced with minimal global styles. All app-specific styles are in App.css.
